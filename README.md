# NDB_Homework

In this homework we at first analize some algorithm to check the connnectivity of a given graph and explore some properties of this argument.

Subsequently the goal was to compare a `Fat-tree` topology with a `Jellyfish` one, comparing their properties about the **Mean Response Time** and the **Job Running Cost** when the computational job is splitted among different servers in the network.

### *`Hw_1` Data Center Topologies*

The aim of this homework was focus on different types of network topologies and explore some properties of them.

In this homework we at first analize some algorithm to check the connnectivity of a given graph. We consider two different random graph: `r-regular random` and `Erdős–Rényi`.

Subsequently the goal was to compare a `Fat-tree` topology with a `Jellyfish` one, comparing their properties about the **Mean Response Time** and the **Job Running Cost** when the computational job is splitted among different servers in the network.
